# TF2-Dodgeball

Yet Another Dodgeball Plugin

This project was made due to Yet Another Dodgeball plugin being incredibly old and being terribly oudated.

A wiki will be setup detailing the config for the plugin.

# Features

- Dodgeball Admin Menu (Allows you to change max rockets and rocket speed, although the rocket speed is somewhat buggy)
- Pyrovision support
- Beep to new target when a redirected rocket occurs
- Steal prevention system
- Speedometer
- Accurate mph and deflection counter on kill
- Disable tauntkilling straight from the plugin
- Airblast Prevention toggle command (To allow for some fun for players which choose it)
